1 ) Reduce Expensive Operations  , the gas cost is calculated based on the op code of the functions that are
called like SSTORE is the opcode takes up a lot of gas cost and should always avoid if possible.

2) Short Circuiting  : You can short circuit the functions to save the gas cost of the other with the higer cost . For ex 
two functions f() and g() , where g() has higher cost , what you can do is keep it like f() || g()  , in this way if f() is true then 
g() will not be executed saving some more gass cost. 

3) Loop Removal : Loops cost gas cost as well , so it will be efficient to remove unnecessary loops and do the calculations in one go. 

4 ) storage takes less gas cost than memeory as it just points to the main data rather than copying it in the memory as done by memory!!.
