Visibility in Solidity :

1) public - the state variable with this visibility can be ascessed from
any contract and can be called and changed from outside the contract as well 

2 ) internal - can be ascessed from within the contract and from the derived 
contract as well.

3 ) private  - can be ascessed from only inside the contract
