Random Number generation in solidity that too securily is a tough job to do in Solidity. 
One common vurnerability that was explotied in the smart conytract that used the number of block head 
in the Ethereum Blockchain to generate the Random  , but this can be very easily exploited by gettiing the 
block head for yourself and passing it to the function that checks for the random function .

One of the secure way of generating a Random Number is by assigning every person with a priavte key and takinng their address and hashing 
the private key with their address , this will generate a number that is somewhat random and cannot be attacked!!
