Try to keep the reverts to a size that is less than 32 bytes so that they dont end up taking another slot , kind of like this : 

function expensiveRevertStrings() {
  require(a < b; "long revert string over 32 bytes");
}

Or you can also write comments on your code if the revert statement is very long that maps the revert statement to the comment , kind of like this : 

// a: long revert string over 32 bytes
function cheapRevertStrings() {
  require(a < b; "a");
}
