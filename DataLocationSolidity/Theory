The main 3 ways of assigning data in solidity is memory , storage and calldata 

Memory and Calldata are local forms of data storage and are used in the paramaeter of the functions to locally store the data
while the execution of the function. 

Memory and Calldata do mostly the same thing , its just that the data in memory can be changed but the data in calldata cant be chnaged .
The data of calldata type is view only and cant be changed in the runtime .
